#h1 AI usage 

This is a detailed guide of my use of generative AI in the course of this assignment.

##h2 To Gemini
Ok so now, make a file expanding on my model architecture and the mathematical logic. 
It should be a .md file, suitable to edit from hackmd, with a focus on intuitiveness of logic.

Do a similar markdown file on how to replicate my work. Note that my training data is saved in the data folder within src, the various python files are in src,
my best training weights are saved as a.pt file in outputs/, docs contains the model_working file and this file.
Make sure to mention required packages (also I had to use python 3.11 specifically
because later versions of python aren't compatible with some of these packages yet)

I'll be pushing the code onto github as different python files, what all references should I change so that the code still makes sense

I also asked Google Colab's inline agent to explain errors for debugging, unfortunately after disconnecting I lost the chat logs with it so I can't reference it here.

##h2 Verification

Since my work using Gemini was mostly making markdown files, I copied it onto hackmd and did further editing myself to get the final desired result. Otherwise while debugging I would check the usefulness of Colab's inline suggestions by the output and runtime
