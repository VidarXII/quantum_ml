# Assignment 3: Scalable Quantum Tomography

This repository contains the scalability benchmarks for a Variational Quantum Tomography model using a Cholesky Ansatz.

## contents
* `Assignment_3.ipynb`: Main source code, experiments, and visualizations.
* `models/`: Serialized model checkpoints and CSV data from scalability runs.
* `docs/`: Technical report discussing scaling limits and ablation findings.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open Assignment_3.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab.

3. Run all cells to reproduce the scalability plots (N=2 to N=12).
